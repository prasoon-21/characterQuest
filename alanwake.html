            <h2>The Writer</h2>
            <p>Alan Wake is a bestselling thriller novelist suffering from a two-year writer's block. He travels to
                the small town of Bright Falls, Washington with his wife Alice, hoping to find inspiration. Instead,
                he finds himself trapped in a nightmare where the darkness itself comes alive, and the manuscript
                pages he doesn't remember writing are coming true.</p>
