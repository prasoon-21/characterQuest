                <p>Arthur Morgan is the protagonist of Red Dead Redemption 2 and a senior member of The Van Der Linde
                    Gang. Known for his toughness and loyalty to Dutch, he gradually questions the gang's ideals and his
                    own violent past, ultimately seeking redemption by doing what he believes is right. A hardened
                    outlaw who finds redemption through self-sacrifice when it matters most.</p>

        <div class="card bg-dark">
            <h3>Early Life (1863 - 1877)</h3>
            <p>Arthur Morgan was born in 1863, during the final years of the American Civil War. His early life was
                marked by instability and loss. His mother died when Arthur was still a child, leaving him emotionally
                scarred and without guidance.</p>
            <p>His father, Lyle Morgan, was a petty criminal and violent man who frequently clashed with the law. Lyle
                was eventually arrested for theft and died in prison.</p>
            <p>Arthur later reflects that his father was not a good man, but still mourns him, suggesting Arthur learned
                early that love and wrongdoing could coexist. With both parents gone, Arthur became an orphan at a young
                age, surviving on the fringes of society.</p>

            <h3>Meeting Dutch (1877)</h3>
            <p>At 14 years old, Arthur attempted a robbery and was caught. Rather than being turned in, he was found by

            <h3>The Outlaw Life</h3>
            <p>Under Dutch's influence, Arthur was indoctrinated into the gang's philosophy:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><u><b>Loyalty above all</b></u> – The gang was family. Betrayal was unthinkable.</li>
                <li><u><b>The world is cruel</b></u> – Lawmen and the rich were enemies of freedom.</li>
                <li><u><b>Taking is justified</b></u> – Robbing banks and the wealthy was framed as a moral act.</li>

            </ul>
            <span class="note">These habits indicate that Arthur never fully embraced the outlaw lifestyle

            <h4>Inner Conflict</h4>
            <p>Arthur's life was survival-driven, but his inner thoughts reveal moral conflict. His artistic tendencies

            <b>3. Rejecting Dutch's Way</b>
