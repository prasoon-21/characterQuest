                <p>Senua is a Celtic warrior from the Orkney Islands, suffering from severe psychosis. After her village
                    is destroyed and her lover Dillion is killed by Northmen, she embarks on a harrowing journey into
                    Helheim to rescue his soul from the goddess Hela. Her quest blurs the line between reality and
                    delusion, where the voices in her head—the Furies—are both her tormentors and guides.</p>

                <h3>The Furies</h3>
                <p>Voices that never stop. They whisper, scream, warn, and mock. Senua's constant companions—
                    manifestations of her psychosis that the player hears through binaural audio.</p>
                <p>They are not enemies. They are part of her.</p>

                <h3>Dillion</h3>
                <p>Senua's lover, the only person who saw past her "darkness." He taught her that her visions were not a
                    curse, but a different way of seeing the world.</p>
                <p>His death at the hands of Northmen broke her completely.</p>

            <div class="card bg-dark">
                <h3>The Blood Eagle</h3>
                <p>Dillion was sacrificed through the Blood Eagle ritual—a horrific Viking execution. Senua carries his
                    severed head, believing she can bring him back if she reaches Hela.</p>

                <h3>The Rot</h3>
                <p>A darkness spreading up Senua's arm. If it reaches her head, she believes she will die—and all
                    progress will be lost forever.</p>
                <p class="note">The game's greatest deception: the rot cannot actually end the game.</p>

                <h3>Zynbel's Curse</h3>
                <p>Senua's father, a Druid priest, believed her psychosis was a curse from the gods. He isolated her,
                    abused her, and called her "Geallt"—the one touched by darkness.</p>

                <h3>Mother's Fate</h3>
                <p>Senua's mother Galena shared her condition. Zynbel burned her alive as a sacrifice to cure their
                    daughter. Senua witnessed it. She was five years old.</p>

                <p>Each boss represents a piece of Senua's trauma. Defeating them is not combat—it is confrontation with

                    the void—not giving up, but moving forward with her grief.</p>

                    her denial, her guilt, her belief that love could conquer death.</p>
                <p>She walks away from Helheim—still hearing voices, still suffering—but finally at peace with who she
                    is.</p>

                <h3>Living with Darkness</h3>
                <p>Hellblade does not cure Senua. Mental illness is not defeated like a video game boss. Instead, she
                    learns to live alongside it. The voices remain. The visions continue.</p>
                <p>But she is no longer ashamed. The darkness is part of her story, not the end of it.</p>
