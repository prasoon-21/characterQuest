            <p>V is a mercenary outlaw going after a one-of-a-kind implant that holds the key to immortality. In the
                dark future of Night City, V navigates a world of corporate greed, street gangs, and cutting-edge
                cyberware. With the digital ghost of Johnny Silverhand in their head, V must fight to survive and
                find a cure before time runs out.</p>

        <div class="card card-wide bg-dark">
            <h3>Night City</h3>
            <p>A sprawling megalopolis in the Free State of California, ruled by corporations and unassailed by the
                laws of both country and state. It's a place of glamour, power, and body modification—where everyone
                has something to hide and everything has a price.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="card bg-yellow">
            <h3>The Heist</h3>
            <p>V and Jackie Wells take on the job of a lifetime—stealing a prototype biochip from Arasaka. Nothing
                goes as planned.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="card bg-pink">
            <h3>Johnny Silverhand</h3>
            <p>A legendary rockerboy and terrorist, now a digital ghost living in V's head. He wants Arasaka to burn.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="card bg-cyan">
            <h3>The Relic</h3>
            <p>A biochip containing an engram—a digital copy of a person's consciousness. It's rewriting V's brain,
                slowly killing them.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="card bg-dark">
            <h3>Street Kid</h3>
            <p>Born and raised on the streets of Night City. V knows the gangs, the fixers, and how to survive when
                you've got nothing.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="card bg-yellow">
            <h3>Nomad</h3>
            <p>From the Badlands outside the city. V values family, loyalty, and freedom over the corporate rat race.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="card bg-pink">
            <h3>Corpo</h3>
            <p>Former Arasaka employee. V knows the corporate world—the backstabbing, the power plays, and how deep
                the corruption goes.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="card card-wide bg-gradient">
            <h3>Cyberware</h3>
            <p>In Night City, flesh is weak. V can upgrade their body with mantis blades, gorilla arms, sandevistan
                time dilation, and optical implants. The more chrome you install, the less human you become—but the
                more dangerous you are.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="card bg-cyan">
            <h3>Netrunning</h3>
            <p>Hack into enemies, breach security systems, and fry neural implants with quickhacks. The Net is
                dangerous—but powerful.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="card bg-dark">
            <h3>Fixers</h3>
            <p>The middlemen of Night City. They connect mercs with jobs—kidnappings, assassinations, data theft.
                Everyone needs a fixer.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="card bg-pink">
            <h3>Jackie Wells</h3>
            <p>V's best friend and partner. A big heart in a bigger body. His dream was to become a Night City legend.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="card card-tall bg-yellow">
            <h3>Arasaka Corporation</h3>
            <p>The most powerful megacorporation in the world. They control technology, security, and banking.</p>
            <p>Saburo Arasaka built an empire. His children fight over it.</p>
            <p>V is caught in the middle of a corporate war.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="card bg-cyan">
            <h3>Panam Palmer</h3>
            <p>A Nomad with a grudge and a tank. One of V's most trusted allies—and potentially much more.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="card bg-dark">
            <h3>Judy Alvarez</h3>
            <p>A braindance technician fighting to protect those the city exploits. Brilliant, passionate, and
                dangerous.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="card card-wide bg-gradient">
            <h3>The Point of No Return</h3>
            <p>V's time is running out. The Relic is overwriting their consciousness. Every choice leads to a
                different ending—some triumphant, some tragic, all unforgettable. In Night City, you can become a
                legend. But legends don't live forever.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="card bg-pink">
            <h3>Silverhand's War</h3>
            <p>In 2023, Johnny nuked Arasaka Tower. Now he wants to finish the job—using V's body if necessary.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="card bg-yellow">
            <h3>The Sun</h3>
            <p>V becomes the ultimate Night City legend. Fame, fortune, and one last job in space. But at what cost?
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="card bg-cyan">
            <h3>The Star</h3>
            <p>V leaves Night City with the Nomads. Freedom, family, and the open road. A chance at a real life.</p>
