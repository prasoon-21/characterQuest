                <p>Solid Snake, born David, is a legendary soldier and former operative of FOXHOUND. A product of the
                    Les Enfants Terribles project, he is a clone of the greatest soldier who ever lived—Big Boss. Armed
                    with an unbreakable will and superior combat skills, Snake has prevented nuclear catastrophe
                    multiple times, yet carries the burden of being a weapon designed for war.</p>

            <p>A nuclear weapons disposal facility in Alaska's Fox Archipelago. FOXHOUND has gone rogue, threatening

            <h3>Summary</h3>
            <p>Metal Gear Solid redefined storytelling in games. Snake's mission to Shadow Moses revealed truths about
                his origins, the military-industrial complex, and the nature of soldiers as tools of war. Kojima's
                masterpiece asks: can a weapon choose its own destiny? Snake's answer: "I'm not a tool. I'm a man."</p>
