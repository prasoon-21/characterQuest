                <p>Revan was a Jedi Knight who became a Sith Lord, then was reborn without memory as a Republic soldier.
                    Their journey across the galaxy to stop the Sith Empire reveals a truth that shakes the very
                    foundation of identity: the hero and the villain are the same person. The greatest threat the
                    Republic ever faced... was you.</p>

        <div class="card card-md bg-dark">
            <h3>The Mandalorian Wars</h3>
            <p>When the Mandalorians invaded the Republic, the Jedi Council refused to act. Revan and Malak defied
                them, rallying Jedi to war.</p>
            <p>They saved the Republic. Then they disappeared into Unknown Space.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Card 2: The Fall -->
        <div class="card card-tall bg-sith">
            <h3>The Fall</h3>
            <p>Revan and Malak returned as Sith Lords, commanding a massive fleet. The Jedi who saved the Republic now
                sought to destroy it.</p>
            <p>What they found in the Unknown Regions turned them to the dark side. The Star Forge—an ancient factory
                powered by the Force itself.</p>
            <p>Revan became Darth Revan. The galaxy burned.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Card 3: Bastila Shan -->
        <div class="card card-sm bg-jedi">
            <h3>Bastila Shan</h3>
            <p>A young Jedi with Battle Meditation—the power to turn the tide of war. She led the strike team that
                captured Revan.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Card 4: The Mind Wipe -->
        <div class="card card-md bg-dark">
            <h3>The Mind Wipe</h3>
            <p>The Jedi Council erased Revan's memories and identity. They created a new person—a loyal Republic
                soldier with no knowledge of their past.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>A new name, a new life</li>
                <li>Force sensitivity remained</li>

        <div class="card card-lg villain-card">
            <h3>Darth Malak</h3>
            <p>Revan's former apprentice and closest friend. When Bastila's strike team attacked, Malak fired on
                Revan's ship—seizing the Sith Empire for himself.</p>
            <p>Now he hunts his former master, unaware that Revan no longer remembers being a Sith Lord.</p>
            <p>His jaw was severed by Revan's lightsaber. He speaks through a vocabulator. His hatred knows no bounds.</p>

        <div class="card card-sm bg-dark">
            <h4>The Ebon Hawk</h4>
            <p>A smuggler's ship that becomes home. Fast enough to outrun Sith Interceptors, old enough to have
                stories.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Card 7: Star Maps -->
        <div class="card card-md bg-jedi">
            <h4>The Star Maps</h4>
            <p>Ancient Rakatan artifacts scattered across the galaxy. Each one holds a piece of the location of the
                Star Forge.</p>
            <ul>

            <h3>The Revelation</h3>
            <p>On the Leviathan, Malak reveals the truth. The player character IS Revan. The Jedi didn't rescue a
                soldier—they reprogrammed the Dark Lord of the Sith.</p>
            <p>Every companion reacts. Carth's trust shatters. Bastila's guilt surfaces. The player must decide: who
                are they now?</p>
            <p>The greatest twist in gaming history.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Card 11: Light or Dark -->
        <div class="card card-md choice-card">
            <b>The Light Side</b>
            <p>Reject the dark past. Redeem Bastila when she falls. Destroy the Star Forge. Prove that anyone can

            <h3>The Star Forge</h3>
            <p>An ancient space station that feeds on the dark side. It can produce infinite ships, infinite droids,
                infinite war.</p>
            <p>The Rakata built it 20,000 years ago. It consumed them. Now it fuels the Sith.</p>

        <!-- Card 14: Bastila's Fall -->
        <div class="card card-tall bg-dark">
            <h3>Bastila's Fall</h3>
            <p>Captured by Malak. Tortured. Broken. She falls to the dark side—becomes his apprentice.</p>
            <p>On the Star Forge, she confronts Revan. If light side, Revan can save her through love. If dark side,
                she becomes Revan's new apprentice.</p>
            <p>The Force bond between them decides the galaxy's fate.</p>

            <h3>The Final Battle</h3>
            <p>Revan faces Malak in the heart of the Star Forge. Former friends. Former Sith Lords. Only one will walk
                away.</p>
            <p>"You cannot win, Revan."</p>
            <p>"You always said that, Malak. You were always wrong."</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Card 16: Summary -->
        <div class="card card-lg summary-card">
            <h3>Summary</h3>
            <p>Knights of the Old Republic asked questions no Star Wars story had before. Can a villain become a hero?
                Is identity defined by memory or choice? Revan's journey—from Jedi to Sith to amnesiac to redeemer (or
                conqueror)—remains one of gaming's greatest narratives. The Force is not about destiny. It's about
                deciding who you want to be.</p>
