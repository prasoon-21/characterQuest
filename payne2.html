                <p>Max Payne is a former DEA agent and NYPD detective haunted by the murder of his wife and daughter.
                    In Max Payne 2, he returns as a broken man still searching for meaning in a world of betrayal and
                    violence. His story is a noir tragedy—a tale of love, loss, and the desperate hope for redemption
                    in the arms of a femme fatale, Mona Sax.</p>
