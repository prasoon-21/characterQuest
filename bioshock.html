            <h3>The Crash (1960)</h3>
            <p>Jack's story begins with a plane crash over the Atlantic Ocean. He is the sole survivor, swimming toward
                a lighthouse rising impossibly from the waves.</p>

            <p>An underwater city built by Andrew Ryan in the 1940s. A place where the artist would not fear the censor,

            <h3>Summary</h3>
            <p>Jack's journey through Rapture is a meditation on free will and control. Built to be a weapon, he
                discovers humanity in the depths of madness. BioShock asks: if you don't know you're being controlled,
                are you truly free? Jack's answer is written in the choices you make.</p>
