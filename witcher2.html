                <p>Geralt of Rivia is a Witcher, a mutated monster hunter for hire. Enhanced by the Trial of the
                    Grasses, he possesses superhuman reflexes, strength, and senses. In <i>Assassins of Kings</i>,
                    Geralt is falsely accused of regicide and must embark on a journey across the Northern Kingdoms to
                    find the true killer, Letho of Gulet, and clear his name while recovering his lost memories.</p>

        <!-- Card 1: Origin -->
        <div class="card bg-dark">
            <h3>Origin: Kaer Morhen</h3>
            <p>Geralt was taken to the witcher keep of Kaer Morhen as a child. He survived the <b>Trial of the
                    Grasses</b>, a painful alchemical process that kills most subjects. It stripped him of
                pigmentation—giving him his white hair—but granted him cat-like eyes and immense resilience.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Card 2: Training -->
        <div class="card bg-accent-wolf">
            <h3>The School of the Wolf</h3>
            <p>Trained by his mentor Vesemir, Geralt mastered the art of swordplay and monster lore.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><u><b>Steel Sword</b></u> – For men and beasts.</li>
                <li><u><b>Silver Sword</b></u> – For monsters and magical creatures.</li>
                <li><u><b>The Medallion</b></u> – Vibrates to detect magic and danger.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <!-- Card 3: Signs -->
        <div class="card bg-dark">
            <h3>Witcher Signs</h3>
            <p>Simple combat magic used by Witchers:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Aard:</b> A telekinetic blast to knock back enemies.</li>
                <li><b>Igni:</b> A burst of flames.</li>
                <li><b>Quen:</b> A protective magical shield.</li>
                <li><b>Yrden:</b> A magical trap to slow foes.</li>
                <li><b>Axii:</b> Mind control and influence.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <!-- Card 4: The Kingslayer Plot -->
        <div class="card bg-accent-blood">
            <h3>The Kingslayer Plot</h3>
            <p>The central conflict of <i>The Witcher 2</i>. King Foltest of Temeria is assassinated by a mysterious
                huge man (Letho), and Geralt takes the blame.</p>
            <p>Geralt must choose his path:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Align with <b>Vernon Roche</b> and the Blue Stripes (Special Forces).</li>
                <li>Align with <b>Iorveth</b> and the Scoia'tael (Elven Rebels).</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <!-- Card 5: Relationships -->
        <div class="card bg-dark">
            <h4>Allies & Sorceresses</h4>
            <p>Geralt's life is intertwined with powerful sorceresses.</p>
            <p><b>Triss Merigold:</b> A loyal friend and lover who aids Geralt in regaining his memory and navigating
                the political chaos.</p>
            <p><b>Yennefer of Vengerberg:</b> His lost love, whom he begins to remember in flashbacks as his amnesia
                fades.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Card 6: Political "Neutrality" -->
        <div class="card bg-accent-wolf">
            <h4>"Witcher Neutrality"</h4>
            <p>Witchers claim to not take sides in politics, but Geralt often finds this impossible. His moral compass
                forces him to intervene when he sees injustice, dragging him into the wars of kings and emperors.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Card 7: Traits -->
        <div class="card bg-dark">
            <h4>Mutations & Potions</h4>
            <p>Before battle, Geralt drinks toxic potions to enhance his abilities. To a normal human, they are lethal
                poison. To a Witcher, they provide night vision, increased regeneration, and heightened reflexes.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Card 8: Letho -->
        <div class="card difficulty-card">
            <h3>Letho of Gulet</h3>
            <p>The primary antagonist—another Witcher from the School of the Viper.</p>
            <p>Unlike simple monsters, Letho is Geralt's equal. He kills kings not for money, but for a secret deal with
                the Emperor of Nilfgaard to sow chaos in the North.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Card 9: Summary -->
        <div class="card summary-card">
            <h3>The Path</h3>
            <p>Geralt's journey is a grim one. He is an outcast protecting a world that fears and hates him. In <i>The
                    Witcher 2</i>, he proves that even in a world of grey morality, choices—and their
                consequences—matter.</p>
