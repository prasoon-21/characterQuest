                <p>Captain Martin Walker is a Delta Force operator sent into a sandstorm-ravaged Dubai on a
                    reconnaissance mission. What begins as a simple search for survivors becomes a descent into madness,
                    war crimes, and the darkest corners of the human psyche. Walker isn't the hero he believes himself
                    to be—and neither is the player.</p>

                <h3>Dubai</h3>
                <p>Six months ago, the worst sandstorms in recorded history buried Dubai. Colonel John Konrad and the
                    33rd Infantry Battalion stayed behind to help evacuate civilians.</p>
                <p>Then all contact was lost.</p>

                <p>Walker fires. The soldiers burn. Then he walks through the aftermath and finds the civilians they

                    himself when the evacuation failed.</p>
                <p>The voice on the radio. The orders. The mission. Walker imagined it all.</p>
