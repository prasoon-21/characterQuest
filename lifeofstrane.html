                <p>Maxine "Max" Caulfield is an 18-year-old photography student who discovers she can rewind time after
                    witnessing the death of her childhood best friend Chloe Price. Returning to her hometown of Arcadia
                    Bay, Oregon, Max must navigate friendships, dark secrets, and impossible choices—all while a
                    devastating storm approaches that threatens to destroy everything she loves.</p>

        <div class="card card-md bg-soft">
            <h3>The Rewind</h3>
            <p>It begins in a bathroom. A gunshot. Chloe falls. Max reaches out—and time reverses. She can rewind
                moments, undo mistakes, explore every possibility.</p>
            <p>But every power has a price.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Card 2: Chloe Price -->
        <div class="card card-tall bg-blue">
            <h3>Chloe Price</h3>
            <p>Blue hair, punk attitude, broken heart. Max's former best friend, abandoned five years ago when Max moved
                to Seattle without looking back.</p>
            <p>Chloe's father died. Her mother remarried. Her friend Rachel vanished. And Max wasn't there for any of
                it.</p>
            <p>Now fate—or Max's power—keeps saving Chloe from death. Again and again.</p>

        <!-- Card 3: Blackwell Academy -->
        <div class="card card-sm bg-warm">
            <h3>Blackwell Academy</h3>
            <p>A prestigious arts school in Arcadia Bay. Home to dreamers, artists, and dark secrets hidden behind
                perfect smiles.</p>
        </div>

            <p>What happened to Rachel Amber?</p>

        <!-- Card 5: The Storm -->
        <div class="card card-lg storm-card">
            <h3>The Storm</h3>
            <p>Max sees it in her visions. A tornado of impossible size bearing down on Arcadia Bay. Friday. This
                Friday. The town will be destroyed.</p>
            <p>Is her power causing it? Can she stop it? Does saving Chloe doom everyone else?</p>
        </div>

        <div class="card card-sm bg-soft">
            <h4>Through the Lens</h4>
            <p>Max sees the world through her camera. Polaroids capture moments that can never be changed—or can they?</p>

        <!-- Card 7: Choices -->
        <div class="card card-md bg-blue">
            <h4>Every Choice Matters</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Save Kate or let her fall?</b></li>
                <li><b>Expose Nathan or protect Chloe?</b></li>

        <!-- Card 8: The Vortex Club -->
        <div class="card card-sm bg-dark">
            <h4>The Vortex Club</h4>
            <p>Blackwell's elite. Rich kids, wild parties, dangerous secrets. Nathan Prescott and Victoria Chase rule
                this world.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Card 9: Kate Marsh -->
        <div class="card card-tall-md memory-card">
            <h3>Kate Marsh</h3>
            <p>A quiet, religious girl destroyed by a viral video from a Vortex Club party. She doesn't remember what
                happened that night.</p>
            <p>She stands on the roof of the dormitory. Max's power fails. Only her words can save Kate now.</p>
            <p>This moment cannot be rewound.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Card 10: Nathan Prescott -->
        <div class="card card-md bg-warm">
            <h3>Nathan Prescott</h3>
            <p>Son of the wealthiest family in Arcadia Bay. Unstable. Dangerous. Protected by money and power.</p>
            <p>He shot Chloe in that bathroom. He drugged Kate. But he's also a victim—manipulated by someone far worse.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Card 11: The Dark Room -->
        <div class="card card-lg dark-room-card">
            <h3>The Dark Room</h3>
            <p>A photography bunker hidden beneath the Prescott barn. Women drugged and photographed in their most
                vulnerable moments. Binders full of victims.</p>
            <p>Rachel Amber's final photograph is here. So is her body.</p>
            <p>Mark Jefferson—beloved teacher, famous artist—is the monster behind the lens.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Card 12: Alternate Timeline -->
        <div class="card card-md bg-blue">
            <h3>The Photograph</h3>
            <p>Max discovers she can jump into photographs—traveling back years, not seconds. She saves Chloe's father
                from dying.</p>
            <p>In this timeline, Chloe is paralyzed. She asks Max to end her suffering. The butterfly effect is cruel.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Card 13: Warren -->
        <div class="card card-sm bg-soft">
            <h4>Warren Graham</h4>
            <p>Science nerd. Loyal friend. Hopelessly in love with Max. Always there when she needs him—even when she
                doesn't notice.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Card 14: The Truth -->
        <div class="card card-tall memory-card">
            <h3>The Truth</h3>
            <p>Every time Max saves Chloe, she tears reality. The storm isn't random—it's the universe correcting
                itself. Chloe was meant to die in that bathroom.</p>
            <p>To save Arcadia Bay, Max must let her die.</p>
            <p>To save Chloe, Max must let everyone else die.</p>
            <p>There is no rewind for this choice.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Card 15: The Endings -->
        <div class="card card-lg bg-dark">
            <h3>Two Endings</h3>
            <p><b>Sacrifice Chloe:</b> Max travels back to the bathroom. Watches Chloe die. Attends her funeral alone.
                Arcadia Bay survives. Their week together—erased.</p>
            <p><b>Sacrifice Arcadia Bay:</b> Max tears the photograph. The storm destroys the town. Everyone they knew
                may be dead. But Chloe lives. They drive away together into an uncertain future.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Card 16: Summary -->
        <div class="card card-md summary-card">
            <h3>Summary</h3>
            <p>Life is Strange asks impossible questions about love, sacrifice, and whether we can truly change fate.
                Max's journey isn't about powers—it's about connection, grief, and learning that some moments can't be
                rewound. The only choice that matters is how much we're willing to sacrifice for the people we love.</p>
